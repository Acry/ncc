You may get this error in a modern GNU system.
Check out the preprocessed source (-ncspp option), and search
for `int8_t'.  If you see a line like

	typedef int int8_t __attribute__ ((__mode__ (QI)));

You've got it. This is serious braindamage from glibc (again).
Please edit the file /usr/include/sys/types.h.  It sais:

	#if !__GNU_PREREQ (2,7)
	... good typedefs
	#else
	... braindamaged typedefs
	#endif

Change the if to

	#if !__GNU_PREREQ (2,7) || defined __NCC__

That's perfectly safe.
